## Motivation
I wanted to create virtual Christmas cards for friends, so I used the general version I had made (https://github.com/cBridges851/Christmas-2020) and made some adjustments so I could put the person's name in the URL and this would be outputted instead of the word "everyone".

## Tech/Framework
This uses A-Frame, a framework that is used to create web VR scenes. This was created inside a HTML file. This project also uses JavaScript find the name in the URL and output it on the banner to replace the word "everyone".

## Installation
- This project is really easy to install if you wish to do so:
- Clone this repository `https://github.com/cBridges851/Christmas-2020-Parameters.git`
- Navigate to the files you wish to view. The HTML file where the A-Frame code is in the root folder.
